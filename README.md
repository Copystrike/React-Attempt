# My React attempt

---

So normally I was planning on learning React in collage as a part of their course.</br>
Unfortunately I failed the entry test, its literally the shittiest test I ever took.</br>
Anyways, I have no idea what this project is gonna become and the fact I am programming this onto my mom's computer using codesandbox.io with this stupid azerty makes it very difficult for me to make something big.</br>
plus, I am literally in the middle of an exam period which makes it even better to learn React!
